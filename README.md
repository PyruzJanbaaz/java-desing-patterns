**Some of the most common Java design patterns**

Java design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. These patterns provide proven solutions to recurring design problems, making it easier for developers to create robust, maintainable, and scalable Java applications. Here are some of the most common Java design patterns:

1. Singleton pattern: This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

2. Factory pattern: This pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

3. Adapter pattern: This pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by creating an adapter class that acts as a translator between two interfaces.

4. Observer pattern: This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

5. Decorator pattern: This pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

6. Facade pattern: This pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.

7. Proxy pattern: This pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

8. Command pattern: This pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

9. Template method pattern: This pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass, allowing subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

10. Iterator pattern: This pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

These are just a few of the many Java design patterns available to developers. Choosing the right pattern(s) depends on the specific requirements of the application and the organization's goals.
