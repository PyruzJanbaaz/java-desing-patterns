**Java design patterns**

Java design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. These patterns provide proven solutions to recurring design problems, making it easier for developers to create robust, maintainable, and scalable Java applications. Here are some of the most common Java design patterns:

___

**Iterator pattern:**

This pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

___

**Pros:**

- Allows iteration over a collection of objects without exposing the collection's underlying representation.

- Supports different types of collections, as long as they implement the same Iterator interface.

- Allows the client code to access the collection's elements in a consistent manner.


**Cons:**

- Requires the creation of an Iterator class for each type of collection.

- Can be less efficient than using a simple for loop, especially for large collections.

___

Here's a **use case** for the Iterator pattern:

Suppose we have a collection of books in a library, and we want to be able to iterate through the collection and display information about each book. We can use the Iterator pattern to create an iterator that allows us to traverse the collection of books and access each book's information.
