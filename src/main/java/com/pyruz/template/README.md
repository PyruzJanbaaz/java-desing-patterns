**Java design patterns**

Java design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. These patterns provide proven solutions to recurring design problems, making it easier for developers to create robust, maintainable, and scalable Java applications. Here are some of the most common Java design patterns:

___

**Template method pattern:**

This pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass, allowing subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.


___

**Pros:**

- Provides a reusable template for a specific process.

- Allows customization of the individual steps of the process.

- Promotes consistency across different implementations of the process.


**Cons:**

- May not be suitable for processes that require significant variations in steps or order of steps.

- May lead to inflexible code if the template method is too rigidly defined.

___

Here's a **use case** for the Template pattern:

Suppose we want to create a simple coffee brewing application that has different types of coffee brewing methods. We want to create a template for brewing coffee that can be reused for different types of coffee brewing methods.
