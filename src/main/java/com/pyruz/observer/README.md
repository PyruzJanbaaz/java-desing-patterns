**Java design patterns**

Java design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. These patterns provide proven solutions to recurring design problems, making it easier for developers to create robust, maintainable, and scalable Java applications. Here are some of the most common Java design patterns:

**Observer pattern:** 

This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Here's a **use case** for the Observer pattern:

Suppose you have a weather monitoring system that includes several sensors, such as a thermometer, a barometer, and a hygrometer, that measure temperature, pressure, and humidity, respectively. You want to display this data on a graphical user interface (GUI) in real-time, but you don't want to continually poll the sensors for their data.

To solve this problem, you can use the Observer pattern. You would define a WeatherData class as the subject that encapsulates the state of the weather sensors. This class would maintain a list of Observer objects that are interested in receiving updates about changes in the weather data.

Each of the sensors would be implemented as an observer that is attached to the WeatherData subject. Whenever the state of any of the sensors changes, they would notify the WeatherData subject, which would in turn notify all the observers of the changes.

Finally, you would implement a Display class that acts as an observer and displays the data from the WeatherData subject on the GUI in real-time. Whenever the state of the WeatherData subject changes, the Display class would receive the update and redraw the GUI accordingly.

By using the Observer pattern in this way, you decouple the sensors from the GUI and simplify the design of the system. New sensors can be added without affecting the GUI code, and the GUI can be updated without affecting the sensor code.
