**Java design patterns**

Java design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. These patterns provide proven solutions to recurring design problems, making it easier for developers to create robust, maintainable, and scalable Java applications. Here are some of the most common Java design patterns:

**Singleton pattern:**

This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.


Here's a **use case** for the Singleton pattern:

Suppose you are developing a database connection pool for a web application. Your application needs to create connections to the database on demand, but you don't want to create a new connection every time a request is made, as this can be slow and resource-intensive. Instead, you want to create a pool of pre-initialized connections and reuse them as needed.

To ensure that your application always uses the same instance of the connection pool throughout its lifetime, you can use the Singleton pattern. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to that instance.

In this case, you can create a DatabaseConnectionPool class that implements the Singleton pattern. This class will maintain a pool of database connections and provide a method to retrieve a connection from the pool.
