**Java design patterns**

Java design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. These patterns provide proven solutions to recurring design problems, making it easier for developers to create robust, maintainable, and scalable Java applications. Here are some of the most common Java design patterns:

___

**Facade pattern:**

This pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.

___

**Pros:**

- Simplifies the complex banking system by providing a simpler interface for the client to interact with.


- Improves code maintainability by encapsulating the complex logic of the various modules.


- Reduces coupling between the client and the underlying system, making it easier to modify or replace individual modules.



**Cons:**

- Can introduce performance overhead due to the additional layer of abstraction.


- Can lead to a bloated Facade class if too many modules and methods are added to it.


___

Here's a **use case** for the Singleton pattern:

Suppose  we have a complex banking system with multiple modules such as Account Management, Transaction Processing, and User Authentication. Each of these modules has multiple classes and methods, and integrating them can be a daunting task. We can use the Facade pattern to simplify the integration process.
