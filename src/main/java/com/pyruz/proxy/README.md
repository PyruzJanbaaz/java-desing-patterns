**Java design patterns**

Java design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. These patterns provide proven solutions to recurring design problems, making it easier for developers to create robust, maintainable, and scalable Java applications. Here are some of the most common Java design patterns:

___

**Proxy pattern:** 

This pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

___

**Pros:**

- The Proxy pattern provides a level of indirection between the client code and the real object, which can help with controlling access to the object.


- The proxy can cache the results of expensive operations, which can help with performance.



**Cons:**

- The Proxy pattern can add complexity to the codebase, especially if there are multiple levels of indirection involved.


- If the proxy and the real object have the same interface, it can be hard to tell which one is being used in the code.


___

Here's a **use case** for the Proxy pattern:

Suppose we have a media player application that can play different types of media files, such as audio and video. 
Playing video files can be computationally expensive, so we want to implement a proxy to cache previously played video files to reduce the loading time.

The proxy should be able to load the video file if it's not already in the cache, and play the video if it's already in the cache.
