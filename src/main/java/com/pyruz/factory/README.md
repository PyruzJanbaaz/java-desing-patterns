**Java design patterns**

Java design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. These patterns provide proven solutions to recurring design problems, making it easier for developers to create robust, maintainable, and scalable Java applications. Here are some of the most common Java design patterns:

___

**Factory pattern:**

This pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

___

**Pros:**

- Encapsulation: The pattern encapsulates the creation of objects, allowing the client code to be decoupled from the specific classes and their implementations.


- Flexibility: The pattern allows for flexibility in object creation, making it easy to add new objects or modify the creation process.


- Consistency: The pattern promotes consistency in object creation, ensuring that objects are created in a uniform manner throughout the system.


- Testability: The pattern makes objects easier to test, as they can be created and mocked in a controlled manner.


**Cons:**

- Complexity: The pattern can increase the complexity of the code, as it requires additional objects and logic to be implemented.


- Overhead: The pattern can add overhead to the system, as it requires additional objects to be created and managed.


- Coupling: The pattern can lead to coupling between the client code and the specific factory implementations, making it harder to modify the system in the long term.


- Scalability: The pattern can be less scalable in larger systems, as the number of factory classes can become unwieldy.

Here's a **use case** for the Factory pattern:

Suppose you are building an application that needs to create different types of shapes, such as rectangles and circles. You want to make your code more flexible and easily extensible in case new types of shapes need to be added in the future.

To achieve this, you can use the factory pattern. You would first define an interface that specifies the behavior of a shape, such as the ability to draw itself on a canvas. Then, you would create concrete classes that implement the interface for each type of shape in the application. For example, you might have a Rectangle class and a Circle class.

Next, you would create a ShapeFactory class that creates Shape objects based on a string parameter that specifies the shape type. This factory class could create objects of different concrete classes depending on the string parameter passed in.

Finally, in your application code, instead of instantiating the concrete classes directly, you would use the ShapeFactory to create Shape objects based on the type of shape required.

By using the factory pattern in this way, you make your code more flexible and easier to maintain, as you can add new types of shapes to the application without having to change existing code.
